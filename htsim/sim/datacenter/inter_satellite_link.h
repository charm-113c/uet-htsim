/**
 * This class is made primarily to work with the 2D torus topology, when the latter is used to
 * simulate computing satellite constellations. As such, it extends Pipe, but modifies the way it
 * computes the delay for doNextEvent().
 * In short, it is meant to simulate how the distance between two satellites --and subsequently, the
 * delay in communication-- is variable rather than fixed. It can thus be seen as a variable-delay
 * Pipe.
 * In all other aspects, it is identical to Pipe.
 *
 * Note: since the Pipe class' _delay field is private and the delay() method isn't virtual,
 * the delay returned by this class in the logs will be fixed and *will not* reflect delay
 * variability.
